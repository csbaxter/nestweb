<p>The requirements for your screen saver are the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li> You must use Scratch to implement this.</li>
<li> The moving object must be a square that bounces around the screen (or Scratch stage as it may be).</li>
<li> The square must change colors when it touches the edge, you should have a minimum of four rotating colors.</li>
<li> The square should have a text message on it, keep it to one or two words.  Something like "Let's Go".</li>
  <li> When the square goes <i>exactly</i> into the corner the square should stop moving and the text message should change to say something else, such as changing from "Let's Go" to "Wizards".</li>
  <li> You can add any other type of celebratory flourish for when the corner is reached.</li>
</ol>

## Submitting

<p>Once finished with your project, save it to your computer as an .sb3 file.  Name the file your first initial + last name + "_screensaver.sb3", so if your name is Harry Potter then the file name will be "hpotter_screensaver.sb3".</p>
<p>Upload your file to the following location: TBD</p>
